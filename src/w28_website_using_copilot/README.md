automating and streamlining the development process, especially for batch processing tasks.

The website was developed by leveraging Copilot's suggestions and automation features, making it easier to generate
code, structure content, and handle repetitive tasks efficiently.

For a detailed walkthrough, prompt samples, insights into the development process, technical details, screenshots, and
