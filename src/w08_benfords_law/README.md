# Visualizing Benford's Law

This week's code visualizes the Benford's Law graph in the terminal from the available data set like world population,
country areas, and count of employees working in the most employed companies.

I have done a Python-based solution previously, you can see it [here](https://github.com/vishnuharidas/benfords-law).

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford's_law):

> Benford's law, also known as the Newcombâ€“Benford law, the law of anomalous numbers, or the first-digit law, is an
> observation that in many real-life sets of numerical data, the leading digit is likely to be small. In sets that obey
> the law, the number 1 appears as the leading significant digit about 30% of the time, while 9 appears as the leading
> significant digit less than 5% of the time.

## Sample Outputs

This output is generated from the population from 194 countries.
