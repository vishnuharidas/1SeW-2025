# T9 Phoneword to Phone Number

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneword):
> Phonewords are mnemonic phrases represented as alphanumeric equivalents of a telephone number. Phonewords are the most
> common vanity numbers, although a few all-numeric vanity phone numbers are used. Toll-free telephone numbers are often
> branded using phonewords; some firms use easily memorable vanity telephone numbers like 1-800 Contacts, 1-800-Flowers,
> 1-866-RING-RING, or 1-800-GOT-JUNK? as brands for flagship products or names for entire companies.

This week's code focuses on converting a T9 phoneword (e.g., "FLOWERS") into its corresponding phone number (e.g., "
3569377"). The implementation is straightforward and relies on querying a pre-defined lookup table for mapping each
letter to its T9 digit.
