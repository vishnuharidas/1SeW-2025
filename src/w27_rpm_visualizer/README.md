# RPM Visualizer

Many years ago, when I was playing around and having fun with IoT devices and electric motors, I wanted to visualize how a particular RPM speed looked and felt, but I couldn't find a simple tool for this purpose. Now, even though there are web-based visualizers available today, I thought of creating one with GitHub Copilot just to give it a try. 

This interactive web application visualizes RPM (Revolutions Per Minute) using a rotating bar animation powered by pure CSS animations instead of Canvas and manual drawing approaches that other tools typically use. Perfect for educational purposes, demonstrations, or understanding rotational speed concepts.
