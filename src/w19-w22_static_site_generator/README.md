# April⋅SSG - a lightweight, simple static site generator

**April⋅SSG** is a lightweight, super-simple static site generator written in JavaScript. It focuses on **minimalism and ease of use**, making it an ideal choice for developers who want to create static websites without unnecessary complexity.

April⋅SSG was born out of my frustration with tools like Jekyll and Hugo. They always seemed to overcomplicate things when all I wanted was a clean, minimalistic site. After countless hours of trial and error, I built a simple static site generator with the help of Copilot.
